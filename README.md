# Kickstarter-project-s-performance-prediction
This is a compilation of python codes created via Google Colab for discovering trends, insights, and anything else of interest about Kickstarter projects.  
And, also makes an effort to create a model which can roughly predict whether a kickstarter project will be successful or not, 
based on Kickstarter Dataset on Kaggle.com (ks-projects-201612.csv). The link for the original dataset is shown below.

The work is separated into 2 parts represented in 2 notebooks
Part 1 notebook would mainly cover data cleaning process and Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) while,
Part 2 notebook would mainly cover data preparation for ML process and ML models creation, evaluation and improvement of the models.
